**Abstract**

This project aims to build a facial expression recognition system for predefined human facial expressions. The existence of universal facial expressions first remarked by Darwin and then later Paul Ekman proposed 6 main facial expressions which are joy, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise and fear. However recently in 2014 a group of researchers from University of Glasgow come up with new findings saying the main facial expressions can be reduced into 4 [1]. The system successfully detects happy and suprized faces real-time. However, its accuracy decreases by 10% at other facial expressions.
